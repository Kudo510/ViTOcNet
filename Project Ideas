Single Image Reconstruction

Paper: 

Pix2Vox: Context-aware 3D Reconstruction from Single and Multi-view Images

https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Xie_Pix2Vox_Context-Aware_3D_Reconstruction_From_Single_and_Multi-View_Images_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf


Dataset: 

ModelNet
https://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu


Modifications:
 
- Addition of color prediction
- In the paper itâ€™s stated that the reconstruction results of are still with low resolution.
The reconstruction resolutions can be improved by introducing GANs
